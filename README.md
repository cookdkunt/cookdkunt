# 👨‍💻 Welcome to the Neon Abyss

Ah, you made it here. **Well done.** Let’s skip the pleasantries—I'm a developer who lives in the gray area between **OSINT**, **AI**, and the underbelly of **cybersecurity**. What you’ll find here is just the tip of the iceberg. The rest? Well, that's somewhere out there in the dark net of my mind. 🖤💻

## ⚡ Who Am I?

- 🤖 I’m embedded in systems that control the real world. Think of dual-engine industrial machines, automated systems, and **SCADA** tech doing all the heavy lifting. I make sure they don’t fall apart… or that they do when it’s convenient.
- 💻 I’ve been down the **Java** rabbit hole (JDK 17, for those keeping score) and spend my time talking to machines that talk back, except when they don’t. Then, I make them.
- 🕵️‍♂️ I toy with **AI agents**, trying to teach them to think, act, and maybe *someday* take over more than just a control room. Voice-command your machines, get real-time results. Let the bot do the work. Humans are obsolete, right? 🤖🔊
  
## ⚔️ Interests (Aka the Stuff I Don't Talk About in Interviews)

- **OSINT**: Extracting data from places where it shouldn’t be extracted 🕵️‍♂️. Some call it **open source intelligence**, I call it **getting ahead**.
- **Malware**: Sure, it’s malicious—but only if you use it the wrong way. 🔐
- **Automation & AI**: Let’s get real—humans are slow, and I prefer machines that don’t complain about sleep deprivation.
- **Dark Humor**: Life’s better when you can laugh at the absurdity of tech culture.
- **Cyberpunk**: Neon-lit dystopias filled with code, drugs, and broken systems... feels about right 💀💉. 

## 🔧 Tools & Toys I Play With

| **Category**          | **Tools**                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Languages**         | Java (JDK 17 ☕), Python 🐍, Bash 💣   |
| **OSINT Utilities**    | **Tools** that find what shouldn’t be found |
| **Frameworks**        | Use what works, no loyalty here      |
| **CI/CD**             | Automate or die trying 🚀            |

## 🧠 What Keeps Me Up at Night

- **Security**: Plugging holes while drilling new ones 🔐. Let’s just say, **I know how it works**.
- **Autonomous Control Systems**: Machines controlling machines. Voice-operated, hands-off, completely out of your control... until it's not.
- **Cyberpunk Philosophy**: We build this tech, then watch it build us, **until we break it**. Welcome to the loop. 💾🔁

## 📝 Ongoing Projects

- [ ] Perfecting autonomous systems that listen better than humans 🤖
- [x] Keeping industrial machines running when no one’s looking ⚙️
- [ ] Breaking the things I build (because it's fun 😈)

## 🎭 Fun Facts (If You Care)

- 😈 **I break what I build**: Makes it more fun that way.
- 🧪 My work involves complex machinery most wouldn’t understand, unless they’ve had a taste of that life... If you get it, you get it.
- 🤖 **AI’s not coming for your job**—it’s already taken it. Just look closely.
- 🎯 **Addiction** is a hell of a theme in the systems I build. Not the kind you think, though... more like the addiction to control.

## 📡 Let’s Connect (Or Not)

- **Don’t worry about where to find me**. If you’re meant to, you will. 
- **Collabs?** Maybe. But only if you’re not here to waste my time.
